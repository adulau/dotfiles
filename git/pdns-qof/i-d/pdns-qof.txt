1.  Introduction

   Passive DNS is a technique described by Florian Weimer in 2005 in
   Passive DNS replication, F Weimer - 17th Annual FIRST Conference on
   Computer Security.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Simple List

   List styles: 'empty', 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers', 'hanging',
   'format'.

   o  First bullet

   o  Second bullet

   You can write text here as well.

3.  Figures

   Figures should not exceed 69 characters wide to allow for the indent
   of sections.

                 Preamble text - can be omitted or empty.

                       +-----------------------+
                       | Use XML, be Happy :-) |
                       |_______________________|

        Cross-references allowed in pre- and postamble.  [min_ref].

   The CDATA means you don't need to escape meta-characters (especially
   < (&lt;) and & (&amp;)) but is not essential.  Figures may also have
   a title attribute but it won't be displayed unless there is also an
   anchor.  White space, both horizontal and vertical, is significant in
   figures even if you don't use CDATA.

4.  Subsections and Tables

4.1.  A Subsection

   By default 3 levels of nesting show in table of contents but that can
   be adjusted with the value of the "tocdepth" processing instruction.

4.2.  Tables

   .. are very similar to figures:


Dulaunoy & Kaplan                 info                          [Page 2]

Internet-Draft             Abbreviated Title                October 2011


     Tables use ttcol to define column headers and widths.  Every cell
                  then has a "c" element for its content.

                        +----------+----------+
                        | ttcol #1 | ttcol #2 |
                        +----------+----------+
                        |   c #1   |   c #2   |
                        |   c #3   |   c #4   |
                        |   c #5   |   c #6   |
                        +----------+----------+

                      which is a very simple example.

5.  More about Lists

   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   short  With a label shorter than the hangIndent.

   fantastically long label  With a label longer than the hangIndent.

   vspace_trick  
           Forces the new item to start on a new line.

   Simulating more than one paragraph in a list item using <vspace>:

   a.  First, a short item.

   b.  Second, a longer list item.

   And something that looks like a separate pararaph..

   Simple indented paragraph using the "empty" style:

      The quick, brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and lived to fool
      many another hunter in the great wood in the west.

5.1.  Numbering Lists across Lists and Sections

   Numbering items continuously although they are in separate <list>
   elements, maybe in separate sections using the "format" style and a
   "counter" variable.

   First list:

   R11 #1

   R12 #2

   R13 #3

   Specify the indent explicitly so that all the items line up nicely.

   Second list:

Dulaunoy & Kaplan                 info                          [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             Abbreviated Title                October 2011


   R14 #4

   R15 #5

   R16 #6

5.2.  Where the List Numbering Continues

   List continues here.

   Third list:

   R17 #7

   R18 #8

   R19 #9

   R20 #10

   The end of the list.

6.  Example of Code or MIB Module To Be Extracted

   The <artwork> element has a number of extra attributes that can be
   used to substitute a more aesthetically pleasing rendition into HTML
   output while continuing to use the ASCII art version in the text and
   nroff outputs (see the xml2rfc README for details). It also has a
   "type" attribute.  This is currently ignored except in the case
   'type="abnf"'. In this case the "artwork" is expected to contain a
   piece of valid Augmented Backus-Naur Format (ABNF) grammar.  This
   will be syntax checked by xml2rfc and any errors will cause a fatal
   error if the "strict" processing instruction is set to "yes".  The
   ABNF will also be colorized in HTML output to highlight the syntactic
   components.  Checking of additional "types" may be provided in future
   versions of xml2rfc.

7.  Acknowledgements

   This template was derived from an initial version written by Pekka
   Savola and contributed by him to the xml2rfc project.

   This document is part of a plan to make xml2rfc indispensable
   [DOMINATION].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide). If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above). If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

9.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
